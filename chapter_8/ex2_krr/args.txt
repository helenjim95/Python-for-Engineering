I first created a list of alphas and gammas to get a model with the best R square and extract the best estimate (alpha and gamma)
from the model and tune to the current model.
The model could have increased the degree, but the higher the degree, the more the model is overfitting.
The KernelRidge regression is however computationally costly and not scalable to datasets with more than a couple of 10000 samples.
The model is also sensitive to outliers, noise, the choice of the kernel parameters and the regularization parameter alpha.
